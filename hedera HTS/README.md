# HTS: Fungible Token

<!-- TODO redact this section in the tutorial -->
The following is a static copy of the tutorial,
and may be out of date.
Please refer to the linked tutorial for the best experience!

## What you will accomplish

- âœ… Create and mint a new fungible token on HTS
- âœ… Query the token balance

This repo, [`github.com/hedera-dev/hello-future-world`](https://github.com/hedera-dev/hello-future-world/),
is intended to be used alongside the tutorial,
[`docs.hedera.com/tutorials/hello-world/hts-ft`](https://docs.hedera.com/tutorials/hello-world/hts-ft/).

<!-- TODO replace with this in the tutorial

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you should have completed the "Create and Fund Account" sequence:
[`github.com/hedera-dev/hello-future-world/tree/main/00-create-fund-account`](https://github.com/hedera-dev/hello-future-world/tree/main/00-create-fund-account/)

## Steps

### Set up project

To follow along, start with the `main` branch,
which is the *default branch* of the repo.
This gives you the initial state from which you can follow along
with the steps as described in the tutorial.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You should already have this from the "Create and Fund Account" sequence.
If you have not completed this, you are strongly encouraged to do so.

Alternatively, you may wish to create a `.env` file
and populate it as required.
{% endhint %}

In the terminal, reuse the `.env` file by copying
the one that you have previously created into the directory for this sequence.

```shell
cd 04-hts-ft-sdkdir/
cp ../00-create-fund-account/.env ./
```

Next, install the dependencies using `npm`.
Then open the script file in a code editor.

```shell
npm install
code script-hts-ft.js
```

***

### Write the script

An almost-complete script has already been prepared for you,
and you will only need to make a few modifications (outlined below)
for it to run successfully.

#### Step 1: Configure HTS token to be created

To create a new HTS token, we will use `TokenCreateTransaction`.
This transaction requires many properties to be set on it.

- For fungible tokens (which are analogous to ERC20 tokens),
set the token type to `TokenType.FungibleCommon`
- Set the token name and token symbol based on your name (or other moniker)
- Set the decimal property to `2` in order to mimic "cents" on your fungible token.
- Set the initial supply to 1 million

```js
    let tokenCreateTx = await new TokenCreateTransaction()
        .setTokenType(TokenType.FungibleCommon)
        .setTokenName("bguiz coin")
        .setTokenSymbol("BGZ")
        .setDecimals(2)
        .setInitialSupply(1_000_000)
        .setTreasuryAccountId(accountId)
        .setAdminKey(accountKey)
        .setFreezeDefault(false)
        .freezeWith(client);
```

#### Step 2: Mirror Node API to query specified token balance

Now query the token balance of our account.
Since the *treasury account* was configured as being your own account,
it will have the entire initial supply of the token.

You will want to use the Mirror Node API
with the path `/api/v1/accounts/{idOrAliasOrEvmAddress}/tokens`
for this task.
- Specify `accountId` within the URL path
- Specify `tokenId` as the `token.id` query parameter
- Specify `1` as the `limit` query parameter (you are only interested in one token)

The string, including substitution, should look like this:

```js
    const accountBalanceFetchApiUrl =
        `https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/accounts/${accountId}/tokens?token.id=${tokenId}&limit=1&order=desc`;
```

***

### Run the script

Run the script using the following command:

```shell
node script-hts-ft.js
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```text
accountId: 0.0.1201
tokenId: 0.0.5878530
tokenExplorerUrl: https://hashscan.io/testnet/token/0.0.5878530
accountTokenBalance: 1000000
accountBalanceFetchApiUrl: https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/accounts/0.0.1201/tokens?token.id=0.0.5878530&limit=1&order=desc
```

Open the URL, that was output as `tokenExplorerUrl` above,
in your browser and check that:

- (1) The token should exist
- (2) The "name" and "symbol" should be shown as the same values derived from your name (or other moniker) that you chose earlier
- (3) The "treasury account" should match `accountId`
- (4) Both the "total supply" and "initial supply" should be `10,000`
    - Note that it is not `1,000,000` because of the 2 decimal places configured

## Complete

Congratulations, you have completed this Hello World sequence! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### Next Steps

<!-- TODO edit below to reflect correct services -->
Now that you have completed this Hello World sequence,
you have interacted with Hedera Token Service (HTS).
There are [other Hello World sequences](../) for
Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS),
and Hedera File Service (HFS),
which you may wish to check out next.

## Cheat sheet

<details>

<summary>Skip to final state</summary>

To skip ahead to the final state, use the `completed` branch.
This gives you the final state with which you can compare
your implementation to the completed steps of the tutorial.

```shell
git fetch origin completed:completed
git checkout completed
```

To see the full set of differences between
the initial and final states of the repo,
you can use `diff`.

```shell
cd 04-hts-ft-sdkdir/
git diff main..completed -- ./
```

Alternatively, you may view the `diff`` rendered on Github:
[`hedera-dev/hello-future-world/compare/main..completed`](https://github.com/hedera-dev/hello-future-world/compare/main..completed)
(This will show the `diff` for *all* sequences.)

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the branch names are delimited by `..`, and not by `...`,
as the latter finds the `diff` with the latest common ancestor commit,
which *is not* what we want in this case.
{% endhint %}
